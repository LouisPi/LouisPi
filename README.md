# LouisPi

LouisPi is a smart home project. I will start off by making a smart security system with RFID, a camera with smart notification and much more. Then I will work on adding more feature to LouisPi and making it easy to replicate in  your own home. After that, LouisPi will become a smart assistant and much more. Any suggestions are welcome and any help is welcome is you spot a bug, can make the code faster or if you have a new feature.
