# LouisPi

LouisPi is a smart home project. I will start off by making a smart security system with RFID, a camera with smart notification and much more. Then I will work on adding more features to LouisPi and making it easy to replicate in  your own home. After that, LouisPi will become a smart assistant and much more. Any suggestions are welcome and any help is appreciated if you spot a bug, can make the code faster or if you have a new feature. 

LouisPi_RFID.py is working and LouisPi_GUI.py is a work in progress. More information will be available soon.
